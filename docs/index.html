            In order to fully leverage the graph structure of our data, we use TigerGraph,
            a graph analytics platform which provides a myriad of tools and resources for graph-based data science
            and machine learning, making it a valuable solution for us. The data we downloaded from pushshift,
            each comment is given in the same format as the following example:
            
            There is a lot of cool data here, but we are most interested in the user who made the comment,
            the subreddit it was posted to and the parent comment if any. Due to the fact that any comment
            on Reddit is either a child of a post of another comment, we can use this parent relationship
            to generate the comment chain graph structure we will set up in TigerGraph. We use this relationship
            to generate our comment to comment edges in our graph where the vertices are the parent and child comments respectively.
            We then use the author field to create edges between user vertices identified by those author names and the comment id's
            as well as subreddit to comment edges using the subreddit name as an identifier for the subreddit vertices.
            Once we have the correct files specifying those vertices and edges, we simply use TigerGraph's tools for
            uploading and mapping the data to generate our graph.
