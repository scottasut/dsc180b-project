    <span style="color:black;"> As the title says, I want to create a Subreddit Recommendation System. I know that this obviously already exists, but I want
    to try recommending subreddits to users by using user interactions as embeddings in my recommender system. How would I go about using graphs to accomplish this?

<!--     Social media has become the most important way for people to access information, connect with friends, and expand businesses.
    Around 70 percent of all Americans use social media to connect with each other and share information.
    The social media platform Reddit is a massive collection of forums where people can share news and content.
    Reddit is made up of more than a million communities known as subreddits; each subreddit consists of a different topic.
    Users in these subreddits can make posts and comments to interact with other users, essentially forming communities with specific interests.
    As of 2022, Reddit has 50 million daily active Reddit users worldwide\cite{lin_2022}. Reddit users are often recommended subreddits based
    on those they have visited or interacted with. Like many other social media platforms, Reddit's
    comment representation is a tree structure where separate replies to a comment are branches. We can think of conversation in one of these trees
    as a comment chain, that is, a set of comments where each one (apart from the first comment) is a reply to one preceding it.
    We will investigate the typical size, shape and diversity of users in each of these chains.
    From a business point of view, the impact of this task would be in user acquisition and user retention. For current users, this would
    help expose them to subreddits they may be interested in, decreasing the likelihood of churn. For newer users without a few established
    subreddit communities they are a part of, immediately exposing them to similar communities may be beneficial in making them recurring
    users rather than one-time users. From a graph perspective, this problem is worth investigating as it can evaluate the relevancy of user
    interactions in a graph-like comment interaction structure as a basis for recommendation systems. We use a graph-based machine learning
    algorithm that assists in recommending subreddits to users based on their interactions with other users in subreddits through comment chains. -->
    
    <h2 class="heading"> Data Preparation </h2>
        <div class = "blank"><div class = "b">
            In order to fully leverage the graph structure of our data, we use TigerGraph,
            a graph analytics platform which provides a myriad of tools and resources for graph-based data science
            and machine learning, making it a valuable solution for us. The data we downloaded from pushshift,
            each comment is given in the same format as the following example:
            
            There is a lot of cool data here, but we are most interested in the user who made the comment,
            the subreddit it was posted to and the parent comment if any. Due to the fact that any comment
            on Reddit is either a child of a post of another comment, we can use this parent relationship
            to generate the comment chain graph structure we will set up in TigerGraph. We use this relationship
            to generate our comment to comment edges in our graph where the vertices are the parent and child comments respectively.
            We then use the author field to create edges between user vertices identified by those author names and the comment id's
            as well as subreddit to comment edges using the subreddit name as an identifier for the subreddit vertices.
            Once we have the correct files specifying those vertices and edges, we simply use TigerGraph's tools for
            uploading and mapping the data to generate our graph.
